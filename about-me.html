    <h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>My goals with this site:</h2>
<p>I have a couple of goals for this site.
The first and most obvious, is to tell a bit about myself, a portfolio, so to speak.
The second is to write some stuff about what I'm learning about, both for my memory and on the off chance that someone finds something I worked with and it helps them.</p>
<h2>My Experience with Tech:</h2>
<p>As a kid I played some video games, both console and PC.
I wouldn't consider my exposure at that point to be above average for my generation.
My first time programming was as a result of my middle school teacher giving a recommendation for Khan Academy's 'Hour of Code'.
They don't offer that program anymore, but my recollection is that it was a basic JavaScript environment where you could draw shapes and make animations.
The project 'p5.js' reminds me a lot of hour of code.</p>
<p>From there, I was fortunate to be able to enroll in some tech and programming classes in high school.
The first class was in Visual Basic, which I don't have a lot of recollection of.
The classes then moved on to Java, where we made games in Greenfoot.
I also was able to do a TA class where I worked on a website to allow students to order from the coffee shop online.
That project did not wind up getting off the ground, but I did learn a large amount about working on my own, doing research, and reading documentation.</p>
<p>After graduating High School in 2018, I went to college at the University of Missouri - Kansas City.
At UMKC, the program starts students off with Python for CS101 and then moves on to C++ in CS201.
After 201, the program branches out and students use languages that the professors choose.
As a result of this, I had exposure to C, C++, C#, Java, Python, and some other less popular languages.
I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2021.</p>
<p>Another fortunate event for me was starting an Internship with Yellow Freight in May of 2020 despite all of the shifts that COVID caused.
I am currently still working as a Developer as Yellow with the same team I started with in 2020.
Right now, I have been working on APIs for our route planning application using Java Spring.</p>
