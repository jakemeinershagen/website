    <h1>Astronomy Beginner Info</h1>
<h2>What is This?</h2>
<p>My hope is that this can be a helpful guide to people who are new to amateur astronomy. I meet people at ASKC events and quite frequently I wish I had a single place I could point them as a helpful reference to at least get them started. That is the goal here. If you are here because I sent you, I'm glad you made it. If you are here from somewhere else, I'm glad you made it too. Astronomy is a great hobby, I hope this is helpful to you and that this is just the start of a long journey in astronomy.</p>
<p>I'm going to try to keep this up to date as I talk to people and try to remember what they asked about and what I feel is lacking on this site.</p>
<p>You will probably notice that I will be mentioning being a member of ASKC several times. If you live in the KC area, joining and attending events is by far the best way to get into the hobby and get some direction. If you aren't from the KC area, finding a club near you is likewise the best way to learn.</p>
<h2>Don't Buy a Telescope</h2>
<p>At least not yet. If you already bought one, that's okay. You can do plenty of astronomy before getting a telescope to get a feel for the hobby. If you go to some events, you can even look through plenty of telescopes before buying one. If you are an ASKC member we have loaner scopes that you can use first to also test the waters.</p>
<p>I like the way that <em>The Backyard Astronomer's Guide</em> puts it, "Buy a telescope only when you know what it can show."<sup id="footref-1"><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Where to Start?</h2>
<p>The single best thing you can do to learn is to find events you can go to, go, and then ask every single question that pops into your head.</p>
<p>Observing vs Information</p>
<p>Observing -- learn at least a few constellations, go to some star parties or public nights, try out binocular astronomy (especially if you already have binoculars), save buying a telescope until you have had some time with the hobby.</p>
<p>Information -- I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPAJr1ysd5yGIyiSFuh0mIL">Crash Course's series</a>.</p>

<h2>Astronomical League Observing Programs</h2>
<p>What is the Astronomical League? It's an astronomy organization created by amateur astronomers for amateur astronomers.</p>
<p>Below I've listed some observing programs and observing resources. These are great ways to have a roadmap of things to do in the astronomy hobby. If you are a complete beginner I recommend starting with the Beyond Polaris Observing Program.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.astroleague.org/observing-program-log-descriptions-guide/">Observing Log Description Guide</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.astroleague.org/messier-observing-program/">https://www.astroleague.org/messier-observing-program/</a> -- note that you can do this with a telescope as small as 3 inches.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.astroleague.org/binocular-master-observer-award/">https://www.astroleague.org/binocular-master-observer-award/</a> -- this is meant to show that you can do a ton of astronomy with binoculars</p>
<p><a href="https://www.astroleague.org/observing-program-selector-grid/">https://www.astroleague.org/observing-program-selector-grid/</a> -- grid for choosing where to go. or just go with what sounds interesting</p>
<p>If you don't have binoculars yet, you will find that there are several programs that have naked eye observations. You can hop around programs and record observations for different ones as you go. I'll try to build up a list of some examples of this at some point.</p>
<p>By completing a program and submitting the information according to the program's page, you can get a certificate for completing it. You need to be a member of the Astronomical League if you want the certificate. If you are an ASKC member, you are already part of the Astronomical League. If you are in a different club, you may also be a member. If you don't have a club around you, don't worry, you can still join the Astronomical League as a <a href="https://store.astroleague.org/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=9">member-at-large</a>.</p>
<h2>Star Maps</h2>
<p><a href="http://stellarium.org/">Stellarium</a> is my favorite star app. If you see me looking up stars on my phone, it's in Stellarium. And it's free. The free version for desktop has all of the features. On Mobile they have a handful of things behind the premium upgrade, still worth checking out if you are looking for a great mobile app.</p>
<p>The jury is still out for me on physical atlases and planispheres. I'm working on it. The star atlas I own is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sky-Telescopes-Pocket-Atlas/dp/1931559317/ref=sr_1_8?crid=3HAIY4BDJBXSY&amp;keywords=sky+atlas&amp;qid=1704260703&amp;sprefix=sky+atlas%2Caps%2C98&amp;sr=8-8">Sky and Telescope Pocket Sky Atlas</a>, this recommendation may change. Frankly, Stellarium is free, so you should just start with that, in my humble opinion.</p>

I think it is mostly focused on professional astronomy setups, and I'm not familiar enough with astrophotography to know if there is a significant difference to amateur setups. However, this gives some great tools for you to use to talk about colors in the images of astrophotographers you meet.</p>

<p>If you are an ASKC member, you have access to the ASKC library. There are some great guides in there that are worth checking out. Also lots of other great books.</p>
<p>Your local library is also likely to have books on astronomy. Look for Dewey Decimal 520. It's neighbor at 530 is Physics, which will also have some great books that apply to Astronomy.</p>
<p>Your local library probably also has an app for eBooks and audio-books. These are great. Ask your librarian about it.</p>

<h2>If You Are an ASKC Member</h2>
<p>General Meetings are great to meet people and learn. We also do 30 minute astronomy before the meeting where you can learn even more.</p>
<p>We do events for members, keep an eye on your email.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on Cosmic Messenger. You'll find events both club related and astronomical events. You'll also find some articles on astronomy.</p>
<p>Night Sky Network is an online calendar we use to track events. Night Sky Network is hosted by Nasa's JPL, they do a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NASANightSkyNetwork/streams">monthly live stream</a> that is also a great resource for learning.</p>
<p>As a member you can also reserve a private night at Powell observatory.</p>
