<h1>Taking on the 20 Games Challenge</h1>
<p>I can't remember how I learned about it, but about a month and a half ago I learned about the <a href="https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/">20 Games Challenge</a>. I've already learned some of the basics of Godot and made some games with it. However, when I looked at the list, the games up toward 10 looked like they would be very challenging at my current skill level. Given that the challenge of the challenge was what drew me to it, I plan to do my best to choose the game that I think will challenge my current skills the most. I think that is the method that will make this the most valuable to me in the long run. Plus, the list reminded me of my programming classes in high school where I made at least a couple of clones of games. The ones that come to mind are Space Invaders and that Tank game on the Wii.</p>
<p>My choice for the first game is <a href="https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/#1">Pong</a>. </p>
<p>I've decided to call it... <a href="https://github.com/jakemeinershagen/ping">Ping</a>.</p>
<p>I'm thinking this one will hopefully be a pretty quick one relative to the others. I'm going to do my best to start tomorrow.</p>
<p>See you in the next one,<br>
