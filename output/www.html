<p>I'm back with Game 6. I decided to skip 5 since I had already created Conway's game of life. It's a bit of a cop out, but I've never liked playing Pacman, so I really didn't want to have to build it.</p>
<p>I've gone for a clone of VVVVVV for this one. It was actually pretty easy to make. I would say the most complex part is getting the camera's to switch between rooms. The way it works now is still a little clunky. I think it could be improved by checking the position of the player and changing to the camera that contains that position. That's a good goal for a revisit.</p>
<p>I think that's all I really have for this one.</p>
<p>See you next time,<br>
