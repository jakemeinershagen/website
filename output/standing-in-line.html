<h2>Stuff to watch out for while you wait</h2>
<ul>
<li>meteors</li>
<li>sattelites</li>
<li>star tours</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Look Through the Scope</h2>
<p>TL;DR: There is a ladder in there. You'll go up and look through a lens in the side of the telescope to see what we are looking at. Make sure to take your time, especially for faint things.  </p>

<h2>What to expect when you look</h2>
<h2>Stuff we normally look at</h2>
<h2>Why red lights?</h2>
<p>Just like a telescope having a larger opening for light helps us see faint things better, making sure your eyes have as big of an opening as possible helps you see faint things better, or in less nerdy words "night vision". Red light are supposed to reduce your night vision by less compared to other light. This doesn't mean that looking into a bright red light won't still close those pupils, so I would consider reading this with your brightness all the way down. Don't worry, it's dark out here, you'll be able to see it.</p>
<h2>Check out the LCT and member scopes</h2>
<ul>
<li>if you showed up after we started and missed something this is a great way to still see that thing</li>
<li>some objects are hard for the big scope to get to. the LCT can typically fill in these gaps</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fun Facts and Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>T Coronae Borealis</li>
<li>If you had an all expense paid trip to anywhere in the galaxy, where would you go?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stuff that you should definitely come back to see and when</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jupiter</li>
<li>Saturn<ul>
<li>will probably start to be back in an observable position by mid-september. Coming back in October is probably a good bet. We should still be able to see Saturns rings this year, though they will be quite thin due to the next thing on the list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Saturn Ring Plane Crossing - 2025</li>
</ul>
<h1>Things to Look For Through the Scope</h1>
<p>Satellites - they'll look like a star moving quickly through the view.</p>
<h2>The Moon</h2>
<ul>
<li>Craters, obviously</li>
<li>Mountain ranges</li>
<li>rills</li>
<li>Shimmering at the edge of the moon (this is atmospheric disturbance)</li>
<li>if it's not a full moon: notice how the most interesting part is where the line of the shadow is (astronomer's call it the terminator). This is why the best time to observe the moon is during all of the days when it's not full. That shadow makes it so you can pick out details that aren't visible when everything is lit.</li>
<li>if it's a full moon: notice how much light the moon actually puts off. look at the sky around the moon and then further away from the moon, see how it washes a bunch of stars out?</li>
</ul>
